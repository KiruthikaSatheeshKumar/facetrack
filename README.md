FACETRACK – Face Recognition Attendance System with Anti-Spoofing & Admin Panel
FACETRACK is a smart, real-time face recognition-based attendance system built using Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, and dlib. It includes an admin dashboard, face registration, live tracking, anti-spoofing measures, and detailed attendance logging.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FACETRACK.git
cd FACETRACK
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If dlib installation fails, make sure to install CMake and required build tools:

Windows: pip install cmake
Linux: sudo apt install build-essential cmake
▶️ Running the App
streamlit run Tracking.py
Once launched, use the sidebar to navigate through:

Admin Login
Face Registration
Live Face Tracking
View Attendance Data
👤 How to Add New Faces
Add a clear frontal image of the person in the dataset/ folder using the format:
[ID]_[Full_Name].jpg
e.g., 4_Tony_Stark.jpg
Use the Register page from the UI to encode and store the new face.
📋 Attendance Logs
Logged into register/attendance.csv
Includes:
Name
Time
Date
🔐 Admin Panel
Navigate to Admin Login from the sidebar
Credentials can be configured in admin_config.yaml
Features include:
Viewing registered users
Monitoring attendance logs
Admin-exclusive controls
🧠 Anti-Spoofing
To avoid false detection (like showing a photo), the system uses:

dlib's 68 facial landmarks model to verify real human movement/structure
Facial geometry validation before logging attendance
📄 Dependencies
Key Python packages:

face_recognition
opencv-python
dlib
streamlit
numpy
pyyaml
pandas
Install them all with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
🙏 Credits
📍 Anti-spoofing uses dlib’s 68-point shape predictor, trained by Davis King
🎓 App structure and attendance system were inspired by DATCT's Face Recognition Attendance System
🙌 Thanks to the open-source community for their contributions and models
